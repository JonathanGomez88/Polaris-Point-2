        <p>
          Polaris Point is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping students progress in their studies.  We believe that no child should be left behind and because we live in the information age where information overload can hinder progress, we developed a fun and interactive alternative to guide students with simple, easy to understand articles.  If you have any issues with our website please don't hesitate to let us know in the contact section.
